# The goo go package

## Package goo is the root of module goo, an implementation of foo for go

There is no functionality in the root package, only in subpackages. 
This module contains personal utilities and tests for use by the 
author. Although you are perfectly free to use anything you find 
here, you should expect things to not only break, but shatter :-)
